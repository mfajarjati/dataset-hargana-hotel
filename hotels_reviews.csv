Table has some ""spot"" not cleaned. Toilet is a bit dusty, toilet floor is also slippery especially when theres water.Theres a person shirt left in the drawer. Room is connected to other room, and it was REALLY, to be honest, disturbing the good quality sleep. The person in other room I stayed having cough all night 1-2.30 AM, plus calling his relatives with LOUD SPEAKER since 5.20 AM in the morning, untill this review was posted.Would like to sleep for sure, but the connected room feature was really annoying in terms of easily transfering other people sound.Please dont go back, unless you want to have SLEEP DEPRIVATION!",dian pratiwi,2 weeks ago on Google,,"Pesen kamar twin di hotel daily Inn bandung syariah, puas banget sama pelayanannya, sama kamarnya dan sama pemandangan dari kamarnya.

Untuk yang pertama kali kesini pasti bingung perlu tanya kang parkir atau pol pp dishub yang menjaga akses ke area pedestrian tsb. 4. Sangat tidak direkomendasikan untuk yang membawa mobil pribadi karena parkir hanya untuk motor di basement dan kalau sudah malam mau parkir ada bapak-bapak yang tugas jaga pintu parkiran hotel minta uang keamanan. INI YANG SANGAT SAYA TIDAK SUKA ISTILAHNYA PEMALAKAN SECARA HALUS. 5.

Disediakan termos listrik, gula, the celup, handuk, sikat gigi , pasta gigi, sabun mandi 7. Breakfast secara alacarte, memilih salah satu dari beberapa menu seperti goreng, nasi campur, mie goreng, ayam mentega, bubur ayam, sayur pakcoy wortel tapi rasanya kurang enak. Ada gorengan yang masih banyak minyaknya bikin tenggorakan gak enak seperti lumpia dan bakwan pucat. Pilihan minuman air putih, kopi, teh, jus semangka. Buah potong hanya semangka berwarna pucat. 8.

Lokasi sangat amat bagus bener bener deket sama alun-alun Bandung (bisa jalan kaki) 2. Parkir hanya untuk motor, dan kalau sudah malam mau parkir ada bapak-bapak minta uang keamanan (bukan dari hotel tapi jaga pintu parkiran hotel) 3. Kalau mau masuk hotel harus lewatin toko baju Kings 4. Checkin hanya bisa di jam 14.00. kurang 5 menit pun gabisa 5. Kolam renang kotor , dan terlihat hanya di kasi kaporit untuk airnya jadi lebih bening (tapi ga di sikat atau di kuras selama disana 3 hari) alhasil jadi ogah untuk berenang 6. Ukuran kamar sangat kecil (untuk superior twin) 7. Tidak ada hairdryer dan setrika (padahal keterangan fasilitas di aplikasi online tersedia) tapi kita bisa pinjam telpon lobby dan housekeeping datang mengantar 8. Kamar mandi SANGAT AMAT KOTOR. Parah kotor sekali (tidak di foto karna jijik). Di dalam kamar mandi, banyak kotoran apalagi di bawah closet banyak rambut dan kotoran² lain . Terus closetnya pun kuning (bekas kotoran). Airnya kadang kecil, karna untuk bilas tidak pakai semprotan, tapi airnya gamau keluar karna kecil (bayangkan saja bagaimana repotnya apalagi kalau buang air besar). Area shower pun sama, kotor dan menggenang setelah di buka tutup saluran airnya penuh rambut yg bikin mampet dan menggenang , lalu sangat licin karna kotor bahaya sekali untuk anak-anak. 9. Disediakan sikat gigi , pasta gigi, sabun mandi , tapi shampoo tidak ada . 10. Breakfast dengan alasan tamu yg pesan sarapan hanya sedikit maka tidak ada buffet , makan menu alacarte, pilihan menunya tentu saja hanya sedikit. Hari pertama pilihan menu : Nasi goreng, mie goreng, ayam mentega, sayur kailan. Gorengan keroket tempe tahu. Daann ... kurang enak hehehe Hari kedua pilihan menu: Nasi goreng, kangkung ayam balado, soto ayam, soun goreng . Hari ini makanannya lebih enak chef nya pun berbeda dengan yg kmarin. Pilihan minuman tidak ada di hari pertama (selain air putih, kopi, teh). Hari kedua ada jus. Buah potong hanya semangka dan melon dan sangat amat pucat warna semangkanya. Dessert pun hanya satu macam di tiap harinya . Yang paling parah adalah saat ambil gelas untuk minum ADA BEKAS LIPSTIK yg artinya tidak bersih saat di cuci Lebih baik menginap disini tanpa pakai breakfast, karena jatuhnya malah rugi 11. Kamar tidak kedap suara, lebih parah suara kamar mandi ruangan sebelah (saluran air kamar mandi sangat bising) alhasil mendengar suara sangat kencang jam 2 malam . Bayangkan jam 2 malam harus denger suara saluran air yg berisik banget , subuh pun berisik sekali suara air (mungkin mau solat subuh) tapi jam 2 malam sangat mengganggu tidur kami. 12. Kolong kasur sangat kotor , debu, sampah, dan lagilagi rambut . Banyak sekali rambut, terlihat asal saat di bersihkannya. Sprei pun kotor ... Untuk pelayanan cukup baik ... tapi bagi saya hanya satu kali pengalaman meninap disini. Kesimpulannya untuk hotel bintang 3 , mungkin bisa di kurangi jadi hotel bintang 2 .

It strikes a good balance between cost and comfort, making it a great option for budget-conscious travelers who don t want to compromise on room quality. The spaciousness of the room was a pleasant surprise, offering plenty of space to unwind after a day of exploring the city.However, I did encounter a minor issue during my stay. The room had a noticeable smell of cigar smoke when I first arrived, which I didn t mind too much personally.

Ada cermin besar juga di kamar. Kekurangan: colokan hanya ada 3 untuk tipe ini, 1 di sebelah bed, 1 di tempat water heater untuk minuman, 1 di ruang tamu, itupun sebenarnya dipakai untuk stand lamp. Trus saklar lampu juga di tembok, jadi kudu berdiri dulu kalo mau matiin lampu Fasilitas lainnya oke banget, ada kolam air hangat, tp sayangnya kali ini belum sempat cobain. Gym dll juga ada tp ga sempet cobain karena lagi fokus kerja. Wkwkwk Sarapan mantab, menu bervariasi, buat yg nginep beberapa hari masih aman, saya sih ga bosen karena bisa gantian coba2 menu yang ada.

It reminded me of toilet spray or some sort of baby wipes. Wasn't pleasant at all. Room itself had a weird layout. I did like that the toilet and shower were separated with their own doors but weird that it wasn't connected with the divider instead. Shower's water pressure was low and had spotty hot water. Most of the time, the water was warm and sometime it'll turn hot for a few seconds before turning warm again. It was weird because during the day, the water seemed warmer than night. Bedsheets had brown stains on them, one patch looked like large smear or chocolate or even waste. It was disgusting! Towels didn't smell too clean. Shower's floor towel was wet and dirty after housekeeping too. Made me wonder if it was actually changed. The only thing I did liked about the room was the absence of carpet.There's two water bottles provided for free next to the sink. However, there were also two large water bottles to be charged if consumed next to the TV.Breakfast. They did offered a lot of options but even with the warm, buffet setting, food were not hot. Weren't as tasty either. Also, they didn't offer orange juice, which was weird.Also, be careful when leaving the hotel. There is an extra step down. Don't be like me and trip every time.

Kamar bersih dan petugas juga cepat membantu ketika proses check-in. Toiletries yang disediakan lengkap, bahkan disediakan juga body lotion. Hanya saja, area shower tidak ada lampu dan mengandalkan lampu ruangan, sehingga agak redup. AC dan Wi-Fi berfungsi cukup baik. Hanya saja, ruangan tidak terlalu kedap suara, ketika siang hari terdengar suara pengunjung anak-anak bermain di kolam renang yang cukup mengganggu apabila ingin beristirahat. Fasilitas ada kolam renang dan gym. Untuk spa, ketika itu sudah tidak ada. Fasilitas gym yang disediakan cukup lengkap dan termaintain dengan baik. Alat-alat terlihat bersih dan dirawat dengan baik. Service hotel sangat baik, proses check-in cukup cepat. Staff sangat ramah ketika berpapasan. Lalu kita diberikan juga voucher diskon untuk kopi di cafe didepannya. Overall, hotel ini termanage dengan sangat baik, begitu sisi penilaian saya sebagai pengunjung. Lokasinya cukup strategis dari pusat kota Bandung, dekat dengan lokasi2 wisata di Bandung seperti Heritage Factory Outlet, Sari-Sari (outlet jajanan), dan lainnya. Di sebelah hotel bahkan ada KFC sebagai pemadam kelaparan pada saat darurat. Daerah sekitar banyak terdapat outlet makanan yang bisa dijadikan pilihan. Selain itu, lokasinya juga tidak bising pada malam hari dari suara-suara kendaraan diluar, sehingga sangat nyaman untuk tidur.

Saya tiba di hotel around 14.40 dan antrian cek in gila panjang lalu saya bertanya kepada salah satu staff business center apakah bisa ada benefit cek in priority sesuai website tapi menurut beliau yang cantik ini tidak bisa. Sepanjang ngantri cek in, sudah banyak mendengar tamu mengeluh kamar belum ready. Ternyata pas giliran saya juga belum ready. Team FO tanggal 5 Juli sangat kacau. Chaos banget kaya orang kebingungan. Saya diminta menunggu kamar ready. Setelah 45 menitan saya diinfo by text bahwa kamar ready dan ambil kunci aja di resepsionis. Dimana saat saya minta kunci, team FO nya masih meminta saya menunggu. Setelah menunggu lagi 15 menitan lagiiii, baru dapat kunci. Itupun team FO nya kabur2an. Saya sangat salut dengan Manajer On Duty tanggal 5 Juli 2024. Kenapa bisa CHECK IN process CHAOS gitu ya? Untuk kamar nyaman dan amenities lengkap. Oh ya welcome drink aja gelasnya kotor. Menunggu satu jam sambil haus agak gimana gitu. Akan tetapi staff housekeeping ramah dan sigap. Sarapan juga variasi oke. Fasilitas kolam banyak anak2. Untuk gym sangat menyedihkan! Alat sedikit dan tidak ada maintainance nya! Mat aja worn out. Tumpukan alat rusak banyak.

After being taken by Lippo group, previously one of the most prestigious Hyatt hotels degraded. Such a shame. But the same trend for all Lippo owned properties.Check in is not efficient, checked in at 5pm and the room was still not ready.The lifts are super slow and need to take service lifts for faster access. No phone in the room, no room service, pretty old room and no intentions for renovations. No USB charging point, smelly toilet.Limited staff, probably they are trying to do cost saving. The breakfast quality is good but it was chaos and many items are gone around 9am. The gym is pretty spooky and left with limited equipment.Parking wise, no card receipt was given. Security tried to block the access by telling us that it's full, while it's not true.Overall poor maintainence. One of the benefits is the larger room and next to the mall.Such a shame for Lippo group ones of the richest group coming this quality.Try to find other hotels like mercure or four points which are able to give you better values for your money and better stay quality",Vanesha Khairana Daffa Harun,a year ago on Google,4,"Overall 4 5.

The rooms were exceptionally clean, complete with a nice hot water supply in the showers and a spotless bathtub. However, the absence of a telephone was notable. We had to use WhatsApp for all communication with the receptionist and room service.Disappointingly, the elevator was a major letdown, particularly when the hotel was busy. We often waited 20-30 minutes just to move between floors. Although there was an option to use the service elevator, its waiting area was unpleasantly smelly, unclean with visible spots, and uncomfortably hot.Additionally, the restaurant cleanliness was not up to par. I found a French bread with a spot that looked like mold. I reported it to the station but nothing was done, so I complained to the receptionist via WhatsApp. The chef came promptly to inspect the bread and assured me that it wasn t mold, but a residue from the oven being improperly cleaned. Seeing the chef s proactive response, I felt confident that the issue would be addressed.On the upside, the hotel s location was convenient, being connected to a small mall. This made it easy to access reasonably priced refreshments and snacks.Regarding their Christmas decorations, I was disappointed to see them turned off during my checkout, unlike the previous day when they were on amidst a busy checkout period.

The corridor is pretty, but the room is quite bland. There is no fridge. Pillows are quite stuffy and they give you only two. Bed is fine. The AC leaked though.Bathroom is kinda differently designed. There's no separator between the shower and the rest of the bathroom, so it can get quite wet after a shower. The shower gel is super simple and a little bit too watery.The lobby is small with a compact receptionist. Staff is friendly. The plus side however there's a decently sized Indomart in the same building, and there are some good restaurants nearby despite being located a bit removed from city center.The breakfast is okay. Mid selection of small Indonesian food but some good sweet dessert.

Jadi kita stay di bandung uda 2 hari,berharap gue pindah ke hotel ini dgn harapan hote tebu ini lebih oke dari hotel sebelumnya,tp setelah smp sini zonk, jauh klo dibading hotel sebelumnya yg sama2 bintang 3. Lahan parkir juga sempit menurut gue,lumayan kuwalahan wkt cari parkir dan petugas security ngga mau mengarahkan dan kurang ramah jg sih menurut gue. Dan puncak kekesalan gue waktu sarapan,petugas reseptionis sama sekali ngga ramah dan jutek,anak gue yg masih tergolong balita disuruh bayar sendiri dong,dgn alesan diatas 5 th uda harus bayar sendiri,oke fine dia cuman menjalankan peraturan dari hotel dan itu jd tugas dia,tapi bisa kan harusnya penyampaiannya lebih ramah,ngga jutek dan keras gtu bahasanya,padahal yg notabennya anak seumuran gitu palagi anak gue yg makannya masih slalu barengan sama emaknya alias dikit banget makannya,buat yg punya anak balita pastinya kalian tau dong porsi makan sarapan anak usia 5th itu seberapa,tapi ttp aja ngga dibolehin dan ttp harus bayar 80ribu,ini bener2 peraturan yg kolot banget menurut gue klo dibanding sama hotel2 sebelumnya yg sekelas bintang 3 masalah sarapan anak usia segitu g pernah sekolot itu kudu detail ditanya dl anaknya umur berapa,gue bisa bilang gini karena di hotel2 sebelumnya sekelas bintang 3,ngga pernah ada petugas hotel terutama reseptionis restoran nanyain hal semacem ini mpe detail bgt gtu jutek g ramah. Gue juga klo nginep di hotel bintang 4 5 di bandung pun jg ngga ada tuh petugas yg nanyain hal macem gini soal sarapan anak macem gini.

I had to call in an engineering personnel to fix that. In the end, he wasn't able to fix the light, and when he took out the AC's dust filter, oh gosh, dust had accumulated so much in there, it looked like the filter hasn't been cleaned in a year or so (photo taken after the filter was cleaned).Then after he left, when I started using the bathroom, the exhaust fan rattles like crazy. The noise was so loud, I asked to have our room changed but the hotel staff wasn't able to provide us with another room. What a terrible hotel to stay in.Breakfast was fine, nothing's special.

Kamar perlu ditingkatkan lg fasilitas keamanannya dengan memasang kembali slot yang sudah rusak setidaknya agar menghindari risiko yang tidak diinginkan. 3. Pada stall Egg corner sebaiknya ditinjau kembali standar penyajiannya dalam hal ukuran tanpa perlu menunggu tamu request. 4.

Pada tanggal 13 sekitar jam 10 pagi, mungkin karena saya menggunakan *motor* kali yaaa, ketika saya di parkiran melihat bebrapa staff sedang membawa catering di parkiran, saya menunggu sebentar untuk memberi mereka jalan terlebih dahulu karena melihat sepertinya membawa itu sedikit repot, ketika saya sudah mendekat motor saya ada 2 pcs kursi besar dong lagi di jemur pas di belakang motor saya, saya melihat beberapa staff melihat ke arah saya termasuk security, tapi tidak satupun membantu untuk mengeluarkan motor saya, minimal bantu geser motor sebelah atau pindahkan kursi yang dijemur tsb ga ada sama sekali, security itu ngeloyor ke pinggir jalan. Yaa mungkin saya juga berharap lebih ingin dibantuin keluar dari parkiran motor maaf cukup 2 hari saja disini, itupun karena memang udah booking dari awal 2 hari , tapi yasudah 2 hari aja cukup... karena keramahan staff di dalam yang menerapkan 3S, senyum, sapa, salam jadi sedikit terasa aneh buat saya karena securty dan staff tanggal 13 pagi di parkiran itu. Memang sih istri saya melihat senyum dr security tsb di pinggir jalan depan pos, tapi dengan tangan terlipat di dada ketika kami keluar ke jalan.

Makanan ringan yang ada di kamar executive, gratis. 6. Kamar exe, kalian dapet akses ke kolam renang di Trans Luxury. Untuk masuk ke sana kalian harus siapin deposit 300rb ( duitnya balik setelah kita selesai renang). Infoin ke resepsionis dulu, habis itu kalian bakal dapet semacam ID, jangan lupa dibalikin lagi setelah renang. Dari resepsionis kalian harus jalan keluar. Akses masuk tetep dari Trans Luxury ya, di lantai 3. Jadi menurutku, make sure bawa baju kering. Gak enak juga kan ya jalan dengan kondisi basah kuyup sejauh itu. 7.
